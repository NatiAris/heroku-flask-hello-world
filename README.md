# heroku-flask-hello-world
The minimal example that just works

[Install Heroku CLI-tools](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)

Log in if you haven't already
```
heroku login
```

In the root of the repo, run
```
heroku create
git push heroku
```

To open the app in browser, run
```
heroku open
```

That's it.
